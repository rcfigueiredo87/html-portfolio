<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ricardo Figueiredo. I was born on March. I work as an Agile Coach.</p>

<p>I am looking on ways to improve my technical skills on software development so I can be a better professional and
  have a more flexible profile.</p>

<p>I like to make sports, specially run and triathlon</p>
